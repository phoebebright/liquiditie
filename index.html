      <h2>The challenge of a rebuilding our Economy</h2>
      <p>Rebuilding our economy offers us challenges and opportunities. The Liquidity Network, a value transfer mechanism that results in an increased money supply in the economy, is an idea that originated with the economist Richard Douthwaite nearly 20 years ago and has been developed on and off since then. It is an idea whose time has come.</p>
      
      <p>Had the lockdown been short lived, we could have simply bounced back with spending being deferred. This will not be the case with many businesses going into liquidation or choosing to close without a viable operating model going forward. How can we support businesses that want to reopen and new businesses that will fill gaps in the supply chain?</p>
      
      <p>One thing we can do is ensure that businesses are not constrained by cash-flow. We can do this by spending Liquidity Network currency into the economy, increasing liquidity, encouraging faster payments, and increasing the velocity of money.</p>
      
      <h2>What is a Liquidity Network?</h2>
      <p>The Liquidity Network is a mechanism for adding additional currency into the economy for a controlled period of time and to provide a flexible means of encouraging certain patterns of spending and discouraging others. It is an electronic means of exchanging goods and services and can be applied at either a city, county or national level.</p>
      
      <p>The Liquidity Network is not a local currency such as the transition town currencies and it is not a mutual credit system like the WIR in Switzerland. It is also not a bitcoin type currency. Although it is tied to the national currency it cannot be bought or sold as it is a closed system.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-6 portfolio-item">

        <h4>
          Getting Started
        </h4>

        <p>The first requirement in creating a Liquidity Network is to find a circuit, where an organisation both spends significantly into the economy and takes payments from the same group of businesses. Let’s take a County Council as an example.</p>

        <p>The County Council starts paying business in part with the LQN currency and agrees to accept the same currency back as payment for rates, service charges and motor taxes. The businesses that accept payments can immediately pay the currency back to the council or spend it with another business.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-6 portfolio-item">

        <h4>
         Building the Network
        </h4>


        <p>The faster and further the currency travels around the economy before it returns to the council the more it benefits the economy, so businesses who spend in a way that meet this aim are rewarded with bonuses and those who do not are charged fees.</p>

        <p>The LQN’s bonus/fee mechanism can also be used to encourage spending in certain sectors whilst discouraging others. For example, to develop resilience in food and energy supply chains rather than continuing our over-dependence on imports. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-6 portfolio-item">

        <h4>
        Completing the circuit
        </h4>

        <p>Unlike traditional bank accounts, a LQN account cannot be overdrawn and receives no interest. Instead, the aim is to keep the balance as near to zero as possible by moving currency on quickly thereby increasing liquidity in the economy.</p>

        <p>When the council receives the currency back in payment for rates etc, the circuit is closed. The council can choose to spend the currency back into circulation again or retire it. In this way the LQN can be closed down over a period of time when the economy has recovered.</p>

        <h2>What next?</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this document is to outline an innovative way of addressing some of the issues which will face every local and national economy in the months ahead. Sadly Richard Douthwaite is no longer with us, but the rest of the team; Graham Barnes, Phoebe Bright, Brian Dillon and Ciaran Mulloy, remain committed to the belief that a closed circuit Liquidity Network is a useful tool in a modern economy and are available to discuss it further with those interested in investigating its practical application.
